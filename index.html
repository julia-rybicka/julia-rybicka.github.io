        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Julia Rybicka. I graduated from the University of Life Sciences in Poznan in the field of Zootechnics. I am also a graduate of postgraduate studies at the University of Economics in Pozna≈Ñ in the field of Sales management. I worked as a sales manager in a manufacturing company.
When I was on parental leave, I decided to change the industry and become a software tester. Privately, I am a happy wife and mother of two wonderful boys.</p>
